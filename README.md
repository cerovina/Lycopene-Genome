# Lycopene-Genome

I created a program for calculating the number of nucleotides and their ratio in a lycopene genome (>NC_015441.3 Solanum lycopersicum cultivar Heinz 1706 chromosome 4, SL3.0, whole genome shotgun sequence).

The number of bases in the result:

Guanine: 10.227.582;
Adenine: 20.093.747;
Cytosine: 10.204.974;
Thymine: 20.090.088
